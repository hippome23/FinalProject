# FinalProjectTutorial 
for country shape program.
By Charlotte Davis

1.	This program will be run using imagenet. You will need to learn the basics of image recognition. You will teach the computer to recognize shapes from set images that you will take. Then plug in your camera to the nano.  
2.	You will need to have you docker set up and be linked to your nano. You will need to also have accept to Jupiterlab. 
3.	The program which is linked in Github. By running the modules, you will define data sets and set up. Each module will set up a different aspect of the code, maybe being data collection, setting up the model or live execution among others. 
4.	After playing each module a display will show with your camera displayed on the screen. Besides other categories and selected options.   
5.	The next important step is taking pictures of your selected countries. The default one’s set are Chili and Brazil. In the extra column I will tell you how to change that if you want to expand your countries list or pick new ones.  
6.	The settings should display a drop down menu of data sets A and B along side another drop down menu displaying the countries chosen. Select Data set A and the first country listed. Take about thirty pictures. These pictures must have a solid-colored background, preferably black with reasonable lighting with minimal shadows. To take pictures of the countries you can print out basic shapes of countries and cut them out. 
7.	You can do this again with data set B and the next country. If you have any more countries continue these steps. Every single time you take a picture the count below should go up. 
8.	Once the count reaches thirty clicks train below and then save. You will now be able to play your program live and be able to point the camera at any object with a solid background and be able to determine which country the shape it most like. 

Extra:
•	When changing or altering the program to include different countries you should go up to one of the beginning modules where the country names are displayed besides categories. If you want to add more countries you can add the next country, added with a comma. You will also need to scroll down and add another letter to data sets. Another thirty pictures is included with each country.
